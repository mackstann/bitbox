measurements done on an intel core quad 2.5ghz

* measuring key-heavy workloads:
    * uses about 15MB per 200k keys
        * with 5-10 byte keys and 1 byte values
        * ~75 bytes per key
    * takes about 1 second to create 10k new keys

* measuring value-heavy workloads:
    * takes about 3 seconds for 1MB of bits, (1000 calls, 1000 bits per call)
